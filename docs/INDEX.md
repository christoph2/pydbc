# pyDBC Documentation

Welcome to the pyDBC documentation. This site provides a GitHub‑Flavored Markdown overview of the library, tutorials, examples, how‑to guides, and API reference.

pyDBC is a Python library for creating and editing automotive network description artifacts, including:
- DBC (CAN Database)
- LDF (LIN Description File)
- NCF (Network Configuration File)

It exposes high‑level creational APIs to build networks, nodes, messages, signals, and related metadata; it also contains a parser and exporters to transform between standardized formats and an internal SQLAlchemy‑backed model.
